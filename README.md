# NSAP_Scheme_Prediction
To predict the NSAP scheme based on the applicant's Data

The Challenge: The National Social Assistance Program (NSAP) is a flagship social security and 
welfare program by the Government of India. It aims to provide financial assistance to 
the elderly, widows, and persons with disabilities belonging to below-poverty-line (BPL) 
households. The program consists of several sub-schemes, each with specific eligibility 
criteria. Manually verifying applications and assigning the correct scheme can be a time
consuming and error-prone process. Delays or incorrect allocation can prevent 
deserving individuals from receiving timely financial aid. 

Solution:The task is to design, build, and evaluate a multi-class classification model that can 
accurately predict the most appropriate NSAP scheme for an applicant based on their 
demographic and socio-economic data. The goal is to create a reliable tool that could 
assist government agencies in quickly and accurately categorizing applicants, ensuring 
that benefits are delivered to the right people efficiently.
